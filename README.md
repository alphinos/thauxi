## - [ ] **The starter one!** :purple_circle:
* It is a game made with Python and Pygame as the third test of the "Algoritmos I"' subject.
* It's a platformer really inspired by the game "Hollow Knight".
* I made the graphics and all the code alone...
* I wanted to make my first programming project ever to be totally mine (childish? I agree)
* Ironically, I could not share some songs and great part of the scenarios because of copyright...
* Creating things with no copyright is kinda hard, but I'll try to stay true to this idea.
* I'm really thankful for the oportunity to make this.
* The font "Gaeilge" is on public domain! I think it's pretty. Credits to father Padraig McCarthy.
* In the future, I'm gonna do a remake of this and - probably - publish it somewhere

As the license suggests, everything here is on public domain so you can use the code and the art at will.
Thank you :D
